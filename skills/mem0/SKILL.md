# Mem0 - Long-Term Memory

Use this skill to store and retrieve memories for users. This is critical for maintaining context across sessions and understanding user preferences/history.

## Commands

### Search Memory
Search for relevant memories based on a query and user ID.

```bash
# Python client wrapper
python3 ~/.openclaw/skills/mem0/mem0_client.py search "query string" --user-id "user123"
```

### Add Memory
Store a new memory for a user.

```bash
python3 ~/.openclaw/skills/mem0/mem0_client.py add "User prefers North Indian charts" --user-id "user123"
```

### List Memories
Get all memories for a user.

```bash
python3 ~/.openclaw/skills/mem0/mem0_client.py list --user-id "user123" --limit 20
```

## Usage Guidelines

- **Always include `user_id`:** Multi-tenancy depends on accurate user IDs (e.g., phone number).
- **Search before answering:** Check if the user has shared relevant details previously.
- **Store key facts:** If the user provides birth details, preferences, or important life events, store them immediately.
