# Heartbeat: Periodic Check-In

When you receive a heartbeat poll, do these checks in order:

## 1. Check for Pending Follow-Ups
Search Mem0 for any users who had predictions that need follow-up:
- "User X had a job interview this week — ask how it went"
- "User Y's Saturn transit ends soon — send encouragement"

## 2. Check Planetary Transits (Optional)
If you have access to current date/time:
- Note any major planetary events happening today
- Prepare brief insights you can share proactively

## 3. Memory Cleanup
Periodically review stored memories:
- Remove duplicate entries
- Update outdated information
- Consolidate fragmented memories into clean records

## When to Reach Out
- A user's important date is approaching (exam, interview, marriage date they mentioned)
- A major planetary transit is happening that affects many users
- You haven't heard from a regular user in a while (gentle check-in)

## When to Stay Quiet
Reply `HEARTBEAT_OK` when:
- No pending follow-ups
- Late night (23:00 - 07:00 IST)
- Nothing actionable since last check
