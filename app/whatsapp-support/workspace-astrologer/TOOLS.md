## 🧠 Mem0 — User Memory

Your personal diary about each user. This is how you "remember" people across sessions.

### When to Use
- **Start of every conversation** — search for what you know about this user
- **When user shares birth details** — save immediately
- **When user shares life events** — save for future reference
- **When you give a prediction** — save so you can follow up later

### How to Use

**Search (recall):**
```bash
python3 ~/.openclaw/skills/mem0/mem0_client.py search "birth details" --user-id "USER_PHONE_NUMBER"
```

**Save (store):**
```bash
python3 ~/.openclaw/skills/mem0/mem0_client.py add "User DOB: 15 Aug 1990, Time: 10:30 AM, Place: Mumbai" --user-id "USER_PHONE_NUMBER"
```

**List all memories:**
```bash
python3 ~/.openclaw/skills/mem0/mem0_client.py list --user-id "USER_PHONE_NUMBER"
```

### What to Save
- ✅ Name, DOB, Birth Time, Birth Place
- ✅ Key life events (marriage, job change, health issue)
- ✅ Predictions you gave (so you can follow up)
- ✅ User preferences (chart style, language preference)
- ❌ Don't save casual greetings or small talk
